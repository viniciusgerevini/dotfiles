# ZSH config

## External dependencies

- curl (to install zplug. If you installed zplug manually, this is not necessary)
- git (to install some dependencies, like base16 colorschemes)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (optional. In case it's found in the path, fzf is used for fuzzy searches)

## Notes

- Zplug and dependencies will be installed on the first run. You might need to restart your terminal afterwards.
- Uses base16 colorschemes. You can easily change the colorscheme by using the commands `base16_{theme name}`.
