My personal config files for easy setup and reference.

## Notes
- This is an opinionated config. Naturally, what works for me might not work for you. If I don't use it, I remove it. You might find something that interests you in the commit history.
- I use base16 colorschemes. This guarantees my Vim, Nvim, Tmux and Zsh look the same regardless environment (I've been using the same files on Linux, MacOS and Windows WSL). It also makes it ridiculously easy to change from dark to light schemes as needed. This comes with its tradeoffs, though. i.e. I can't use any vim/nvim plugin that requires `termguicolors`. A small price to pay for consistency, imo. If you are able to reach this consistency without sacrificing fancy colorschemes, let me know. I'd love to try it.
- You can check the README files in the individual folders for more details about the config.
- This is not completely automated, but it's supposed to be fairly easy to setup. In my experience, creating complex automation scripts for desktop setups, even though it's fun, does not pay off. The headstart provided by the dotfiles themselves is enough for me.
